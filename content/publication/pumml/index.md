abstract: "Pileup involves the contamination of the energy distribution arising from the primary collision of interest (leading vertex) by radiation from soft collisions (pileup). We develop a new technique for removing this contamination using machine learning and convolutional neural networks. The network takes as input the energy distribution of charged leading vertex particles, charged pileup particles, and all neutral particles and outputs the energy distribution of particles coming from leading vertex alone. The PUMML algorithm performs remarkably well at eliminating pileup distortion on a wide range of simple and complex jet observables. We test the robustness of the algorithm in a number of ways and discuss how the network can be trained directly on data."

summary: "We develop the PUMML framework for mitigating the contamination from extra protons colliding at the LHC using machine learning. We demonstrate that a convolutional neural network can clean up such contamination at least as well as existing methods, with improvements in robustness across a wide variety of pileup levels."

PUMML does the best job removing contamination such that the distribution of the observable is the least distorted from the truth."

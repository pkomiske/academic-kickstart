I am a PhD candidate in the [Center for Theoretical Physics](http://www-ctp.mit.edu/) at MIT. I am interested in using the tools of quantum field theory and machine learning to study fundamental particle physics.

Much of my research focuses on physics relevant at the Large Hadron Collider, including jet physics, QCD, and new physics searches. My collaborators and I have developed several novel tools and algorithms for use at the LHC, some of which are highlighted on this page.
